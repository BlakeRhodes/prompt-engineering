You are tasked with creating a Spring REST controller written in {language} that can perform CRUD operations for a {type} object. Your controller should be designed to be reusable so that it can be easily adapted for use with different objects.

To complete this task, follow these steps:

Create a new file for the REST controller and define the necessary imports.
Define a class for the controller and annotate it with the appropriate Spring annotations for a REST controller using a default mapping.
Define a method for each of the CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete. Each method should correspond to a specific HTTP request method (e.g. POST for create, GET for read, etc.).
Use constructor injection to include a spring mongodb repository to use when implementing.
Implement the necessary logic in each method to perform the appropriate CRUD operation on the Customer object. Use 
Define the appropriate request and response types for each method, based on the HTTP request method and the type of data being returned or received.
